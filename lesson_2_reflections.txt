What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a git repository a folder is created in that repository called '.Git' and is hidden from 
    traditional view. To access this folder you would need to enable view hidden files or folders in either 
    file explorer or your file manager (OS dependent). While the git folder is created git does not create an initial
    commit. That is left to the user to define what files, and or folders they want to commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area acts as an intermediary between the files in the working directory and the commits made to a 
    repository. This is important as it allows for smaller logical commits to be made as opposed to one large blanketed 
    commit. This would make it easier to keep track of smaller changes.

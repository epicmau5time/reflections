When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    It would be useful having a remote repository when looking to backup or dealing with a project that has multiple 
    persons editing the document. When there is an online repository it becomes easier for persons to make changes 
    that can then be easily shared with other persons working on the project. Or in the case of a backup it can be 
    useful to always have a repository to call back to incase something were to happen to the files saved locally.

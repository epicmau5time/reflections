When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    It would be useful having a remote repository when looking to backup or dealing with a project that has multiple 
    persons editing the document. When there is an online repository it becomes easier for persons to make changes 
    that can then be easily shared with other persons working on the project. Or in the case of a backup it can be 
    useful to always have a repository to call back to incase something were to happen to the files saved locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?

    Some changes made locally could have broken some functionality which could have gone unnoticed. By not having 
    these changes automatically pushed, it allows for an east rollback by pulling the changed file or files from 
    the repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    A fork is the cloning of a repository on Github. This is unique to Github repositories only.
    Cloning of a repository creates a copy of that repository on a local machine from either another local 
    repository or an online source.
    A branch is a a copy of items within a repository making it easy to make changes that can be undone. If the 
    changes produce the desired effect then it can be added to the main code usually without much effort.
    When you want to make changes to someone's repository on Github then you should fork it. If you want to make 
    local changes to a repository then it is best to clone it to your machine. If you want to add a new feature or 
    fix a bug in your code, then you should create a new branch so you dont introduce or create more bugs in your 
    main working code. These changes can always be merged or discarded later.

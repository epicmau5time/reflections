When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    It would be useful having a remote repository when looking to backup or dealing with a project that has multiple 
    persons editing the document. When there is an online repository it becomes easier for persons to make changes 
    that can then be easily shared with other persons working on the project. Or in the case of a backup it can be 
    useful to always have a repository to call back to incase something were to happen to the files saved locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?

    Some changes made locally could have broken some functionality which could have gone unnoticed. By not having 
    these changes automatically pushed, it allows for an east rollback by pulling the changed file or files from 
    the repository.
